===== 1. /ingest/ingest_file.php =====
Required for ingest offset and bashfile name
Here you can select the image file (text photo scan) to use for setting offsets. The 'ingest_file.php' only shows the 'books' folder, subfolders with 'navis' in the name, 'Tiff' and 'Jpeg' folders, and '.tif' and'.jpg' file types. A '.jpg' file is will be used. A '.tiff' file will be copy-converted to .jpg. After selecting an image 'ingest_offset.php' starts automaticly. 

===== 2. /ingest/ingest_offset.php ===== 
Optional, submit can be pressed directly.
An box with default offset values will be showed. (The default values come from ingest_params.tsv: left_softleft, left_softright, left_softtop and left_softbottom). The box can be resized to the correct offset of the selected page. To use the offset set the radio box to left- or right- page and submit. After submit, 'ingest_fields.php' starts automatically.

===== 3. /ingest/ingest_fields.php =====
Parameter fields shown in 'ingest_fields.php' are defined in 'ingest_params.tsv'.
The values with a green indicator are manually inputted by the previous 'ingest_offset.php' page or by editing an input box.
The values with a red indicator are the defaults defined in 'ingest_params.tsv'.
The values with a black indicator are previous committed values form the bash file.
The commit button is to commit to the bash file.
The refresh diagnostics can be used after the bash file is execution is completed and results are expected.
Ingest other page goes back to 'ingest_offset.php', and is meant to select an right page after a left one (or the other way around).
